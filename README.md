Whenever a user submits a burger, the entry will be sent to a MySQL database.  The app will the display the burger in the DOM! -- Waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to "Burgers Devoured" section in the DOM. Once clicked, the Devoured condition will also change for the corresponding burger.
